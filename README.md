# digital sensor
Components:
Arduino Uno: The main microcontroller.
PIR Sensor: Motion sensor connected to digital pin 10.
Red LED (connected to pin 8): Indicates no motion detected.
Blue LED (connected to pin 12): Indicates motion detected.
Two Resistors: To limit current through the LEDs.
Breadboard: For assembling the components.
Jumper Wires: To connect the components.
What will happen when the code runs?
If motion is detected by the PIR sensor:

The red LED (pin 8) will turn off.
The blue LED (pin 12) will turn on.
If no motion is detected:

The red LED (pin 8) will turn on.
The blue LED (pin 12) will turn off.
Main idea: The system switches the LEDs' states to indicate whether motion is detected or not.
